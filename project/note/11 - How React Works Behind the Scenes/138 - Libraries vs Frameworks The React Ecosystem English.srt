1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,070
‫All right.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,010
‫And now to finish off this section

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,760
‫let's talk about something entirely different.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,190
‫So this lecture is not really

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,950
‫about how React works behind the scenes,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,010
‫but more about what React actually is,

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,440
‫which is a library.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,590
‫So for future React developers like you

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,290
‫it's important to understand what it means

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,850
‫that React itself is a library and not a framework.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,610
‫And so let's now learn about the differences,

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,133
‫as well as the React ecosystem.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,160
‫And to understand the difference

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,680
‫between a framework and a library,

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,500
‫let's start with an analogy.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,800
‫So imagine that you want to make your own sushi

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,240
‫for the first time,

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,290
‫just like I did recently for the first time as well.

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,580
‫So, you have two choices about how you want to do it.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,070
‫The first option is to just buy one

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,470
‫of those all in one sushi kits,

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,890
‫which will come with all the ingredients that you need

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,610
‫and so then you don't have to buy anything separately.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,000
‫All you have to do is to assemble these ingredients

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,100
‫into your sushi.

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
‫However, there is also a downside to this

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,800
‫because now you are stuck with the ingredients

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,220
‫that are included in the kit that you bought.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,510
‫So if you find out

30
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,120
‫that you don't like one of these ingredients,

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,730
‫then you still have to use it anyway.

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,610
‫Now, instead of getting an all in one kit,

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,830
‫you also have to option to buying

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,110
‫all the ingredients separately.

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,870
‫And so this will give you complete freedom

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,270
‫to choose only the best ingredients

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,880
‫and the ones that you like the most.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,930
‫On the other hand,

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,230
‫all this freedom can give you decision fatigue

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,690
‫because now for each ingredient

41
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,200
‫you need to research which brand is the best option

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,510
‫and then you also have to go buy each

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,610
‫of the products separately.

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,960
‫And even worse,

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,800
‫if one of your selected brands changes or is no longer sold

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,160
‫then you need to start the whole process over.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,993
‫Now, okay,

48
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:11,707
‫but probably at this point you're wondering,

49
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:15,660
‫"Why is he going on and on about sushi?"

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,920
‫Well, the reason is

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,700
‫that this analogy actually translates beautifully

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,850
‫into the difference between building a web application

53
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,480
‫using a framework or using a library.

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,020
‫So we could actually just replace the images here

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,000
‫and call it a day.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,980
‫So, we could describe Angular, Vue, or Svelte, for example

57
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,900
‫as the all-in one kit

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,530
‫and React as buying separate ingredients.

59
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,620
‫And the pros and cons of building a web up

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,510
‫with each of these approaches

61
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,820
‫are basically exactly the same

62
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,760
‫as in making sushi at home.

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,720
‫Okay, but actually, let's now replace these terms

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
‫with their actual definitions

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,250
‫and actually learn what's the difference

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,120
‫between a framework and a library.

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,700
‫So, in the world of JavaScript

68
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,820
‫a framework is basically a complete structure

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,460
‫that includes everything that you need

70
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,690
‫in order to build a complete large scale application.

71
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,070
‫We can say that frameworks

72
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,860
‫like Angular are batteries included

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,550
‫because they include stuff like routing, styling,

74
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,340
‫HTTP requests for management,

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,670
‫and more all out of the box.

76
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,340
‫Now, the downside of this is that you're stuck

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,040
‫with the framework's tools and conventions

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,580
‫even if you don't like or agree with them.

79
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,430
‫However, that's actually not always bad.

80
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,780
‫And so this is not a real downside for some developers.

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,220
‫Now, on the other hand,

82
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,500
‫we have JavaScript libraries,

83
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,630
‫which are basically pieces of code

84
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,320
‫that developers share for other developers to use.

85
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,890
‫And the prime example here is of course, React,

86
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,340
‫which is what we call a view library,

87
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,240
‫view because all React does is to draw components

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,370
‫onto a user interface,

89
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,310
‫so onto a so-called view.

90
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,750
‫Now, if you want to build

91
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,600
‫a large scale single page application,

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,680
‫you will need to include many external third party libraries

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,680
‫for things like routing, styling, HTTP requests, and so on.

94
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,960
‫So all these functionalities are not part of React itself

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,100
‫unlike what happens with Angular and other frameworks.

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,500
‫And so this is how this notion

97
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,130
‫that React is a library ties into the analogy

98
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,700
‫of buying separate ingredients to make sushi.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,950
‫Because to build a React app,

100
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,430
‫we have to choose all these separate libraries.

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,350
‫Now, don't get me wrong here.

102
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,850
‫We can actually build React apps with just React itself.

103
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,490
‫So, without using any libraries,

104
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,490
‫but that only makes sense for small apps

105
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,970
‫or while we are still learning React.

106
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,120
‫Now, being able to choose multiple libraries

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,490
‫in order to build your application

108
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,860
‫offers you incredible freedom

109
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,750
‫because you can choose exactly

110
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,270
‫the ones that you like the most.

111
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,900
‫And also every app will have different requirements.

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,290
‫And so each app will require a different combination

113
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,460
‫of libraries.

114
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,960
‫And so including all of them

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,380
‫in a framework might not even be necessary.

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,390
‫However, on the other hand,

117
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,440
‫the implication of this is that as a React developer,

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,420
‫you need to be able to find

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,060
‫and download all the right libraries

120
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,520
‫for your specific application.

121
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,890
‫And of course, on top of that

122
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,430
‫you then need to learn how to use these libraries

123
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,150
‫and even stay up to date with them over time.

124
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,710
‫But don't worry, it's actually not as bad as it may sound.

125
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,470
‫So, if you follow this course until the end

126
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,720
‫you will have a very good understanding

127
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,290
‫of the most important libraries that we usually include

128
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,600
‫into most React projects,

129
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,990
‫which leads me actually to the next point,

130
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,990
‫which is React's huge third party library ecosystem.

131
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,070
‫So, React's huge popularity has led to a really,

132
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,270
‫really large ecosystem of libraries that we can include

133
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,800
‫in our React projects for different needs like routing

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,180
‫for single page applications, making http requests,

135
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,490
‫managing remote server state,

136
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,950
‫managing global application state,

137
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,000
‫styling, managing forms, animations and transitions,

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
‫and even entire UI component libraries.

139
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,650
‫Now, I will not go over all of them here one by one

140
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,200
‫because that just takes too much time

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,980
‫and you can also just research them if you need.

142
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,220
‫So instead, I will show you which ones I consider

143
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,320
‫the most important libraries

144
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,500
‫and so these are the ones that we will use later

145
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,580
‫in the course.

146
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,670
‫So things like React Router, React Query,

147
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,033
‫Redux, styled components, or Tailwind.

148
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,430
‫Now, many React developers actually do feel overwhelmed

149
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,550
‫by having to take so many decisions and choosing

150
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,760
‫between so many third party libraries.

151
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,300
‫And so this fact, among some other reasons,

152
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,130
‫has led to the development

153
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,640
‫of multiple opinionated React frameworks

154
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,693
‫such as Nextjs, Remix or Gatsby.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,810
‫So, Nextjs or Remix are React frameworks

156
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,190
‫because they are actually built on top of React.

157
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,180
‫So they basically extend React's functionality

158
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,290
‫and they are opinionated because other developers basically

159
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,070
‫included their own opinions into how to handle stuff

160
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,320
‫like routing, state management,

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,113
‫or styling into these frameworks.

162
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,590
‫So, where in a traditional React app,

163
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,490
‫we have to make decisions about what libraries to include

164
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,370
‫in an app built with a React framework.

165
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,290
‫Some of these important decisions

166
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,430
‫have already been taken away from you, the developer.

167
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,090
‫And so this makes project development much easier

168
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,740
‫and much faster,

169
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,000
‫and it can also lead

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,720
‫to a better overall developer experience.

171
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,740
‫Now, different frameworks specialize in different aspects,

172
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,740
‫but all of them offload much of the setup work from you.

173
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,440
‫Also, all of them offer many other advantages

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,930
‫besides just being opinionated,

175
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,030
‫such as server side rendering

176
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,760
‫or static site generation.

177
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,510
‫In fact, we can even describe many of these frameworks

178
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,510
‫as full stack React frameworks

179
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,300
‫because they include so many features

180
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,350
‫that we can actually build full stack apps with them,

181
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,443
‫all while using React as the base layer.

182
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,570
‫But anyway,

183
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,290
‫this is just a brief overview of React frameworks.

184
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,360
‫We will learn a lot more about this

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,340
‫in the last part of the course

186
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,580
‫where we will actually build a very large project

187
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,933
‫using Nextjs.

188
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,000
‫Now, this will not be included in the course at launch time,

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,700
‫but I will include it at a later point.

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,490
‫But at this point, I just wanted to let you know

191
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,500
‫that these frameworks exist

192
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,470
‫because of course we can only learn about them

193
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,080
‫once we really master React itself

194
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,443
‫and also its most important third party libraries.
