# What is state management?

ğŸ‘‰ State management: Deciding when to create pieces of state, what types of state are necessary, where to place each piece of state, and how data flows through the app.

# Types of state: Local vs Global State

Local State
ğŸ”¥ State needed only by one or few components
ğŸ”¥ State that is defined in component and only that component and child components have access to it (by passing via props)
ğŸ”¥ W should always start with local state

Global State
ğŸ”¥ State that many components might need.
ğŸ”¥ Shared state that is accessible to every component in the entire application. (For example: Context API, Redux)
